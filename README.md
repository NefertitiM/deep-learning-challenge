# Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to develop a machine learning model using deep learning techniques to predict the success of organizations applying for funding from the Alphabet Soup nonprofit foundation. By analyzing historical data, we aim to identify key features that correlate with successful funding utilization and provide a tool for improved applicant selection.
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
From Alphabet Soup’s business team, you have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

- **Target Variable**: 
  - `IS_SUCCESSFUL`: This binary variable indicates whether the funding was used effectively (1 for successful, 0 for unsuccessful).

- **Feature Variables**: 
  - `APPLICATION_TYPE`: Type of application submitted.
  - `AFFILIATION`: The sector the organization is affiliated with.
  - `CLASSIFICATION`: Government classification of the organization.
  - `USE_CASE`: Specific use case for which funding is requested.
  - `ORGANIZATION`: Type of organization applying.
  - `STATUS`: Current active status of the organization.
  - `INCOME_AMT`: Classification of the organization's income.
  - `SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS`: Any special notes regarding the application.
  - `ASK_AMT`: Amount of funding requested.

- **Variables to Remove**: 
  - `EIN`: Identification number of the organization (not useful for prediction).
  - `NAME`: Name of the organization (not useful for prediction).

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- **Neurons, Layers, and Activation Functions**:
  - **Neurons**: 
    - First hidden layer: 64 neurons
    - Second hidden layer: 32 neurons
  - **Layers**: 
    - Input layer
    - Two hidden layers
    - Output layer
  - **Activation Functions**: 
    - ReLU for hidden layers (to introduce non-linearity)
    - Sigmoid for the output layer (to predict probabilities)

- **Achieved Target Model Performance**: 
  - Initially achieved approximately 72.65% accuracy.
  - Target performance of over 75% was not achieved in the first attempt.

- **Steps Taken to Increase Model Performance**:
  - Experimented with different architectures (adding layers and neurons).
  - Adjusted activation functions and learning rates.
  - Increased the number of epochs to allow for more training time.
  - Utilized dropout layers to reduce overfitting.
  - Conducted data preprocessing to handle categorical variables effectively.

## Summary

The deep learning model developed in this analysis demonstrated a solid foundation for predicting the success of funding applications, achieving an initial accuracy of approximately 72.65%. However, this was below the desired threshold of 75%. 

### Recommendation for Different Models
To potentially enhance predictive performance, I recommend exploring the following alternatives:

1. **Random Forest Classifier**: 
   - **Pros**: Handles categorical variables well, reduces overfitting through ensemble methods, and provides feature importance metrics.
   - **Explanation**: Random Forest can capture complex interactions between features without extensive tuning, making it a robust option for this classification problem.

2. **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**:
   - **Pros**: Often outperforms other algorithms in classification tasks by focusing on misclassified instances.
   - **Explanation**: GBM's iterative approach could help refine the predictions further, especially if the dataset has strong feature interactions.

By implementing these models alongside the deep learning approach, we could achieve more reliable predictions for the success of funding applications.
